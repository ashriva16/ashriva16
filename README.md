## 🧠 About Me

I'm a researcher working at the intersection of materials science, machine learning, and data-driven experimentation. I specialize in **scientific machine learning (SciML)**, **numerical modeling**, and **optimization of physical systems**. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I develop intelligent experimentation strategies to accelerate scientific discovery.
